# Hostel Registration App

A **React Native** mobile application designed to simplify hostel registration for students. Users can sign up, log in securely, view room availability (or similar flows), and complete registration requests with a responsive, device-friendly interface.

Streamlining student hostel allocation — secure, responsive, and easy to use on any phone.

## Features

- Secure user authentication (signup/login with token-based checks, role-based UI visibility, and login redirects)
- Responsive layouts that adapt beautifully to different screen sizes (phones, tablets)
- Dynamic UI elements like adjustable card widths based on device dimensions
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS & Android)
- Thorough testing across multiple devices and emulators
- Clean, readable codebase with proper Git workflow (feature branches, atomic commits)

## Technologies Used

- React Native + Expo (for development, testing, and builds)
- JavaScript (with potential for TypeScript later)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Frontend authentication layer
- Mobile emulators + real device testing (iOS/Android, various screen sizes)gt
- Explored: Expo EAS Build, managed vs bare workflow, BaaS options (Firebase, Supabase, Appwrite)

## Project Status

Ongoing project. Currently focused on UI responsiveness, authentication security, code quality, and preparing for backend integration (real data storage, room availability, admin features).

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
